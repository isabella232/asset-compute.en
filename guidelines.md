# Guidelines to Contribute to the Documentation

## Documentation Philosophy

We know that the users work in a highly competitive environments, striving to create digital experiences that set them apart from their competitors. Therefor it is vital that when Adobe delivers advanced new tools, that these tools are complemented with accurate and clear documentation to allow the customer to immediately leverage their investment and maximize ROI.

The goal is to put documentation into the hands of its users as soon as possible. Therefore we prioritize accurate, usable documentation and strive to continually update and improve it.

## Documentation Contributions

To continually improve the documentation, the entire community of users is welcome to contribute to the documentation. Be it through pull requests or issues, improvements to the documentation can be corrections, clarifications, expansions, and additional examples.

## Documentation Standards

While we welcome contributions to our documentation, any contribution to the documentation, either in the form of a pull request or an issue, should conform to our contribution and documentation standards. Contributions that do not meet these standards may be rejected.

### We document standard use cases and not workarounds

The documentation covers standard use cases. Use cases beyond the scope of standard and supported installation and usage of the product are not part of the documentation. For this reason, defects, effects caused by defects, and workarounds for defects are not generally not documented.

Exceptions to this rule is release notes where known issues can be listed with possible workarounds that are approved by Adobe.

### Documentation contributions are not to answer customer queries

Any ideas you may have to improve the documentation are welcome as contributions. However comments, issues, and pull requests are intended for *contributions* only. They are not intended to be used to answer your questions about how to use the product, implement projects, or solve technical issues.

Any questions about the usage or technical errors you may have should be reported through the normal support process via the [Experience Cloud Enterprise Support portal](https://helpx.adobe.com/contact/enterprise-support.ec.html) or discussed in the [Experience Manager community](https://forums.adobe.com/community/experience-cloud/marketing-cloud/experience-manager).

The documentation contributions are not a replacement for Adobe Customer Care*** and any such contributions seeking answers to support-related questions will be rejected.

### Contributions must clearly reference affected documentation pages.

If you create an issue to suggest improvements to the documentation, you must include links to the pages affected. If you create an issue by using the **Edit this page** link on a documentation page, the issue will be created with a link to the page automatically.

This does not apply to pull requests since pull requests by their nature reference the affected page(s).

## Documentation Guidelines

We ask that any contributions to our documentation follow certain style guidelines.

Following these guidelines makes the review of your contribution easier and therefore integration into our documentation is faster.

### Language and Style

#### Language

* The documentation is authored and is maintained in US English.
* Keep sentences as simple as possible.
* Keep the language clear and concise.

Remember, readers of the documentation are worldwide and can not be expected to be native or fluent English speakers. Avoid colloquialisms and keep the language as clear and simple as possible.

#### Follow Microsoft Manual of Style

[The Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) is a freely available documentation style guide that focuses on software documentation.

### Formatting

|                     Item                     |      Style       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| UI Element or option                         | **bold**         |
| Filename, path, user-input, parameter-values | `monospaced`     |
| Code, command line                           | ```Code Block``` |

### Screenshots

Screen shots are to be used judiciously and only when a textual description is insufficient.

Do not use markers or other annotations such as red frames, arrows, or text on the screenshots. This way the screenshots are easier to re-use and replicate in localized versions of the documentation.

### Version-specific References

Try to avoid any direct references to a specific version throughout the documentation content whenever possible. This makes the documentation more flexible and extensible for future versions.
